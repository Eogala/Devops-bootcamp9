# The Story of Life Before Docker

Before Docker, deploying applications was cumbersome and often frustrating. Developers faced challenges when transitioning from development to production environments due to inconsistent configurations. Let's imagine a scenario:

#### **The Developer's Struggle:**
shade is a developer who just finished writing a Python web application. It works perfectly on her machine, but as soon as she hands it off to the operations team to deploy on the production server, problems begin to arise.

- **Dependency Hell:** The operations team doesn’t have the exact version of Python or other dependencies needed to run the app. After hours of debugging and configuring, they finally match Sarah's environment, but at the cost of valuable time.
- **Environment Inconsistency:** Sarah’s app used libraries that behave differently on her Mac compared to the Linux servers in production.
- **Scalability Issues:** When the app grows and multiple servers need to run it, each server must be carefully configured to ensure compatibility, which is error-prone and costly.
