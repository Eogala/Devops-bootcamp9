# The Story of Life Before Docker

Before Docker, deploying applications was cumbersome and often frustrating. Developers faced challenges when transitioning from development to production environments due to inconsistent configurations. Let's imagine a scenario:

#### **The Developer's Struggle:**
shade is a developer who just finished writing a Python web application. It works perfectly on her machine, but as soon as she hands it off to the operations team to deploy on the production server, problems begin to arise.

- **Dependency Hell:** The operations team doesn’t have the exact version of Python or other dependencies needed to run the app. After hours of debugging and configuring, they finally match Sarah's environment, but at the cost of valuable time.
- **Environment Inconsistency:** Sarah’s app used libraries that behave differently on her Mac compared to the Linux servers in production.
- **Scalability Issues:** When the app grows and multiple servers need to run it, each server must be carefully configured to ensure compatibility, which is error-prone and costly.
#### **The Virtual Machine Era:**
To solve these issues, virtual machines (VMs) were introduced. VMs allow developers to package their applications and the entire operating system together, which ensures consistency. However, VMs are heavyweight:
- **Large size:** VMs contain entire operating systems, which consume significant amounts of CPU, RAM, and storage.
- **Slow startup:** Because of the large size, booting up VMs can take several minutes.
- **Inefficiency:** Running multiple VMs on a single server consumes a lot of resources.

Shade's team struggled with these limitations. They needed something faster, more efficient, and easier to manage. Enter **Docker**.

### What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies how applications are built, shared, and run across environments. Containers solve the very problems Shade and her team faced:
- **Lightweight:** Unlike VMs, containers share the host operating system’s kernel, making them significantly smaller and faster.
- **Consistency:** The environment inside a Docker container is identical across development, testing, and production. You can run the same container on your laptop, in the cloud, or anywhere else without worrying about compatibility issues.
- **Portability:** Containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, making applications truly portable.

In essence, Docker allows you to package your app and its dependencies into a small, isolated unit known as a **container**.

### How Docker Works

Docker uses a **client-server** architecture:
1. **Docker Client:** The CLI tool you use to interact with Docker.
2. **Docker Daemon:** The background service (or server) that manages images, containers, networks, and volumes.
3. **Docker Images:** A read-only blueprint for creating containers. Think of an image as the recipe and the container as the dish.
4. **Docker Containers:** These are the running instances of images. A container is like a lightweight, isolated environment where your app runs.

### Docker Images vs Containers

- **Docker Image:** A static file containing the code, dependencies, and runtime for your app. Images are built from Dockerfiles, which we'll explore shortly.
- **Docker Container:** A container is a live, running instance of an image. You can have multiple containers running from the same image, each operating independently.

### Dockerfile: Building Your First Image

## Step 1 Provision an instance

- Spin up an Ubuntu 24.04 t2.micro this is where we'll be doing the project in

- SSH into the instance
